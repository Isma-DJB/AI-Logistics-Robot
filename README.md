# AI-Logistics-Robot

AI-Logistics-Robot is a modular autonomous-logistics-robot project developed through simulation first and physical integration second.

The Version 1 mission is triggered by a light target. One robot travels to a safe cell near that target, avoids obstacles, simulates collection, and returns to its base using the path of confirmed outbound poses.

## Current status

**Implementation Draft I-0.4 - GridWorld and movement rules**

This draft implements the first concrete V1 platform adapter: a
deterministic and headless GridWorld behind the public SimulationPort
contract.

GridWorld maintains one configured robot pose and simulated elapsed time.
It executes STOP, TURN_LEFT, TURN_RIGHT, and MOVE_FORWARD commands.
Movement outside the grid is rejected with OUT_OF_BOUNDS, while obstacles
and the target cell are rejected with BLOCKED. Every failed movement
preserves the confirmed pose.

The adapter is publicly exported, structurally compatible with
SimulationPort, and verified against the validated V1 reference
configuration. It runs without Pygame, hardware, or additional runtime
dependencies.

Planning, Memory, Brain orchestration, Control, graphical rendering, and
physical integration remain intentionally deferred. I-0.5 will introduce
Planning and Memory behavior.

## Architecture

The V1 core is divided into the following modules:

- `domain`: immutable data objects, enumerations, and domain rules;
- `ports`: public contracts known by the core;
- `brain`: mission orchestration and state machine;
- `planning`: path calculation and validation;
- `perception`: normalized observations and local hazard information;
- `control`: motion-step construction and safety operations;
- `memory`: confirmed path, events, and mission result;
- `adapters`: simulation, visualization, monitoring, and physical hardware;
- `app`: configuration, dependency assembly, and execution loop.

Concrete platforms remain behind adapters. The Brain must never import Pygame, GridWorld, Arduino, or ESP32-specific code.

## Requirements

- Python 3.11 or newer
- Git
- VS Code with the Python extension recommended

## Local setup

### Windows PowerShell

```powershell
py -3.11 -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

### Linux or macOS

```bash
python3.11 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

Install the optional simulation dependency when the Pygame work begins:

```bash
python -m pip install -e ".[dev,simulation]"
```

## Verification

```bash
python tools/check_project_structure.py
python -m unittest discover -s tests -p "test_*.py"
python -m ruff check .
python -m mypy src
python -m pip check
python -m ai_logistics_robot
```
